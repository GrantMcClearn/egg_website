Lily is from Newtown-upon-Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire. She's a senior CS major at GWU (but not for long!). In the fifth grade, she correctly guessed
that there were seven hundred and eighty-six Jelly Belly jelly beans in a jar, and so got to take all of them home (much to the chagrin of her peers). 
In her free time, she enjoys running
on the National Mall, going to amusement parks with adequate social distancing measures, and mountain biking.

Julia was raised on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. From a very young age, she manifested an intense interest in vacuum cleaners, which eventually blossomed into her interest in Computer Science; she is also a senior CS major. Her vacuum cleaner interest has since waned, but she is still a die-hard Dyson fangirl.
In her free time, she loves going to Wendy's with her family and friends, and selling spare computer parts that she extracts from her father's work computer.

Harmon was born and bred in Vienna, Virginia. He is an avid student of Computer Science and History. His top three favorite wars are, in no particular order,
the Russo-Japanese War, the War of the Seventh Coalition, and the First World War. He loves to go between his home and the actual Vienna in Austria. The latter has a superior opera scene, better street food options, and all around good vibes. Otherwise, he spends his days re-reading Shakespeare's Hamlet and watching
Catfish: The TV Show.
